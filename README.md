This project analyzes customer and lead data to optimize advertising strategy for a motorbike company experiencing high outreach but underperforming conversions.

The objective was to identify high-value customer segments across three regions (North America, Europe, and Pacific) and provide data-driven recommendations to improve marketing efficiency and budget allocation.

Using demographic and behavioral variables (age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income, homeownership, number of children, number of cars, and commute distance), the analysis segmented audiences into:

• Core customer profiles (high interest + high conversion)

• Potential customer profiles (high interest + low conversion)

Key insights revealed strong regional differences in purchase behavior:

• North America: High lead volume but low conversion (43%), indicating friction in the sales journey.

• Europe: Stable performance (~50% conversion) with education and occupation as strong differentiators.

• Pacific: Highest conversion rate (60%) but low outreach, suggesting strong product-market fit and expansion potential.

Cross-variable analysis refined regional buyer personas such as:

• Young Urban Professionals (high-conversion singles in their 30s)

• Established Married Men (high-interest but under-converting segment)

• Urban Professional Singles (Pacific high-value profile)

The project concludes with targeted marketing recommendations and measurable KPIs including conversion rate, CPA, CTR, lookalike audience performance, and A/B testing metrics.

This analysis simulates a real-world marketing optimization scenario where customer segmentation is leveraged to improve acquisition efficiency and strategic decision-making.
